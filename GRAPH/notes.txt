Graph: represented using nodes and edges (V,E) or (n,m)
Types: Undirected and Directed graphs
Weihted graphs: edges have some weight or cost
Connected Components: A graph can contain components that are individual graphs.
Ways to represent graphs:
    Adjecency Matrix: size (n+1, m+1)
                    space complexity: (n+1)*(m+1) --> high
    Adjecency list: Array of vector where vector contains the adjecent nodes.
                    syntax: vector<int> graph[n];

Graph traversal: 
BFS(Breadth first search): travel level-wise through the entire graph
DFS(Depth first search): traval depth wise through all nodes

No of Provinces: no of components of a graph
